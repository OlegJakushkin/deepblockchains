# ZK-STARK: MIMC

Author: Sourabh Niyogi ([`sourabh@wolk.com`](mailto:sourabh@wolk.com))

### Background

ZK-STARKs are going to be widely applicable as a trust primitive for providing space/time efficient probabilistic proofs: valid state transitions in multiple layers of blockchains (e.g. including a STARK proof with each block), proving valid erasure coding, among other computational traces.   They do not require a trusted setup and are post-quantum resistant.

This is a Go-based port of Vitalik Buterin's [ZK-STARK/MIMC tutorial code](https://github.com/ethereum/research/tree/master/mimc_stark),
which concretely explores Ben-Sasson et al (2018)'s [Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proofs of Proximity](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/report/2017/134/):

* [STARKs, part 1: Proofs with Polynomials](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/11/09/starks_part_1.html)
* [STARKs, part 2: Thank Goodness it's FRI-day](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/11/22/starks_part_2.html)
* [STARKs, part 3: Into the Weeds](https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/07/21/starks_part_3.html)
* [Introduction zk SNARKs+STARKs - by Eli Ben-Sasson @ Technion Cyber and Computer Security Summer School](https://youtu.be/VUN35BC11Qw?t=20m7s)

This is not production-level code -- it is meant for blockchain engineers learning how ZK-STARKs (with MIMC VDFs) can be incorporated into next-generation blockchain designs.

## Performance

Basic parallelization (go routines, WaitGroups) of the proof generation and verification have been added, with a first pass review of big.Int usage.
